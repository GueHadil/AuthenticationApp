## 📌 Project Description

This project aims to develop an application that manages user authentication and access, providing the following features:

### 🔐 Main Features

1. **User Registration**  
   The application allows the registration of multiple user roles:  
   **Administrators, Managers, Workers, Teachers, and Students**, through a dedicated registration form.

2. **Registration Request Management**  
   After authentication, the **Administrator** can view, review, and **approve or reject** registration requests.  
   Applicants are **notified by email** about the outcome of their registration request.

3. **User Authentication**  
   This feature enables users to authenticate and access their **role-specific workspace**  
   (Administrator, Manager, Worker, Teacher, or Student).  
   In case of authentication failure, an **error page** is displayed.

4. **Forgot Password Recovery**  
   The application provides a **password recovery mechanism** that allows any user to reset their password  
   via an **email notification**.
